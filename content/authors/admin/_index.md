I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign][uiuc].

My research interests lie in deep learning, natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning, the vibrant multi-disciplinary research field that focuses on integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. My enthusiasm is to build more human-like interactive agents to better understand, interpret and reason about the world around us.

I began my Ph.D. studies in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech][vt], advised by Prof. [Lifu Huang][lifu] and Prof. [Ismini Lourentzou][il], and later transferred to UIUC to further expand my research capabilities. I obtained my Master of Science degree in Intelligent Information Systems from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] and my Bachelor’s degree from [School of Software Engineering][se], [Fudan University][fdu]. Previously, I worked with Prof. [Louis-Philippe Morency][lp] and Prof. [Graham Neubig][graham] at CMU.

I am honored to have been awarded the [Amazon-VT Fellowship][amazon_fellowship] for the 2023-2024 academic year.

<!-- I have also spent time doing research at Apple (2023). -->
