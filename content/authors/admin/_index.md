I am a PhD student of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech][vt].

My research interests lie in deep learning, natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning, the vibrant multi-disciplinary research field that focuses on integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. My enthusiasm is to build more human-like interactive agents to better understand, interpret and reason about the world around us.

I obtained my Master of Science degree in Intelligent Information Systems from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] and my Bachelor’s degree from [School of Software Engineering][se], [Fudan University][fdu]. Previously, I worked with Prof. [Louis-Philippe Morency][lp] and Prof. [Graham Neubig][graham] at CMU.
