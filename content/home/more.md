- I love painting. To me, painting is like another medium (besides verbal and nonverbal behaviors) for expressing feelings and thoughts.

- I enjoy traveling, exploring new restaurants, watching Japanese animations, and swimming.

- I can speak Shanghainese (native), Chinese Mandarin (native), English (fluent), and Japanese (conversational).

- I hope to use technology to help minority groups and improve peopleâ€™s quality of life.
