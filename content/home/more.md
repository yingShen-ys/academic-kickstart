- I can speak Shanghainese (native), Chinese Mandarin (native), Japanese (conversational), and English.

- I “worked” as a little art editor at a teenage magazine office where I was paid for each illustration I drew from seven years old to fifth years old. 

- I love painting. To me, painting is like another medium (besides verbal and nonverbal behaviors) for expressing feelings and thoughts.

- I enjoy traveling, exploring new restaurants, watching Japanese animations, and swimming.

- I hope to use technology to help minority groups and improve people’s quality of life.
