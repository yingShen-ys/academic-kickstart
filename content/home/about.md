# About

I am a second-year master student in the [Language Technologies Institute][lti] of [School of Computer Science][scs] at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu], and a member of [MultiComp Lab][multicomp]. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Louis-Philippe Morency][lp]. 

My research interests lie in deep learning, multimodal machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. 

<!-- I interned with Prof. [Justine Cassell][justine] at [ArticuLab][articulab] on Socially Aware Robot Assistant.  -->

<!-- Before CMU, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Fudan University in 2017. -->

<!-- In addition to research, I  -->

<!-- Passionate learner and traveler. -->
