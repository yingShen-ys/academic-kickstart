# About

I am a second-year master student in the [Language Technologies Institute][lti] of [School of Computer Science][scs] at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu], and a member of [MultiComp Lab][multicomp]. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Louis-Philippe Morency][lp]. 

My research interests lie in deep learning, natural language processing and multimodal machine learning, the vibrant multi-disciplinary research field that focuses on integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. I am particularly interested in learning representations that are robust against the heterogeneity of the data and improving the understanding and generation of human language with the help of other information sources, such as facial expression and voice. My enthusiasm is to build more human-like interactive agents to better understand, interpret and reason about the world around us with multimodal data.

Before coming to CMU, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree from [School of Software Engineering][sse], [Fudan University][fudan]. In Summer 2016, I was a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University working with Prof. [Justine Cassell][justine] at [ArticuLab][articulab] on Socially Aware Robot Assistant.
